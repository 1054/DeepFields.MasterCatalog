# Erb+2014:
# Broadband optical (UnGR) imaging in the Q1700 field is described by Shapley et al. (2005).
# Candidate LAEs were
# selected from a deep narrow-band image obtained with the Large
# Format Camera (LFC) Wide-Field Imager on the Hale 200 inch
# telescope at Palomar Observatory in 2007 July. 
# Near-IR spectra of the rest-frame optical emission lines of
# the LAE sample were obtained with the MOSFIRE (McLean
# et al. 2010, 2012) on the Keck I telescope. 
# 
# Nineteen of the thirty-six galaxies in the LAE sample are covered by the HST Advanced Camera for 
# Surveys (ACS) and/ or WFC3 imaging: six LAEs in the Q1700 field were imaged by ACS in the course 
# of our Cycle 14 program focusing on the Q1700 protocluster (PI Shapley, data described by Peter 
# et al. 2007), and images of 13 SSA22 LAEs have been retrieved from the archive. All 19 LAEs are 
# covered by ACS using the F814W filter, and several of the SSA22 galaxies are covered by ACS F625W 
# and WFC3 F160W as well. We measure magnitudes for the LAEs, and determine their sizes by fitting 
# a two-dimensional Se ́rsic (1963) profile with GALFIT (Peng et al. 2010), for which the size a 
# is the effective half-light radius along the semimajor axis. These procedures are described in 
# detail by Law et al. (2012b).
