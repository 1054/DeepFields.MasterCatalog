# Description of the ZFIRE survey on "https://zfire.swinburne.edu.au/data.html":
#   We release galaxy redshift catalogue and 1D spectra for 2 cluster fields for observations carried out 
#   between 2013âˆ’2015 over 13 MOSFIRE nights. MOSFIRE nights were awarded to the ZFIRE program by a combination 
#   of Swinburne University (Program IDs- 2013A W163M, 2013B W160M, 2014A W168M, 2015A W193M), Australian National  
#   University (Program IDs- 2013B Z295M, 2014A Z225M, 2015A Z236M), and NASA (Program IDs- 2013A N105M, 2014A N121M)  
#   telescope time allocation committees.
#   Please refer to Nanayakkara et al. 2016 for further details.

# Flag_Cluster_Member = True means objects that are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in either the 
#   COSMOS (Yuan+ 2014ApJ...795L..20Y) or UDS (Tran+ 2015ApJ...811...28T) fields.

# Description of quality flags on "http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/ApJ/828/21/zfire_uds" (Note 2):
#   Quality flag as follows:
#     1 = These are objects with no line detection with S/N<5. These objects are not included in our final spectroscopic sample.
#     2 = These are objects with one emission line with S/N>5 and a |zspec-zphot|>0.2.
#     3 = These are objects with more than one emission line identified with S/N>5 or one emission line identified with S/N>5 with a |zspec-zphot|<0.2.
