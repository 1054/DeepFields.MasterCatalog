# Description of fields on "https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJ/877/81" (Note 1):
#   Field: COSMOS, VVDS, EGS, UDS or "serendip".
#   All serendipitous detections are given the Field "serendip". While some of these correspond to sources 
#     in existing photometric catalogs, we have not applied IDs here. The coordinates we provide are correct 
#     and can be cross-checked against the literature. The catalog contains a small number of known duplicate 
#     observations.
# 
# Description of quality flags 
# see "https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/256/9" (Note 2),
# see also "https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJ/877/81" (Note 2):
#   Note (2)  : Quality flag from DR1 (Masters+ 2017, J/ApJ/841/111) as follows:
#   4.0 =   Unambiguous redshift identified with multiple features or the presence of the split [OII]λλ3726,3729 doublet;
#   3.5 =   very high confidence but based on a single line detection;
#   3.0 =   high confidence redshift with a low probability of an incorrect identification.
#
