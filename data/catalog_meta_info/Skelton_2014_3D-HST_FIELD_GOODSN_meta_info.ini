# Notes on spec-z in Skelton+2014:
# There are 2081 spectroscopic redshifts included in the GOODS-N catalog. These were obtained by matching 
# to the MODS catalog (Kajisawa et al. 2011). The MODS redshifts are compiled from Yoshikawa et al. (2010), 
# Barger et al. (2008), Reddy et al. (2006), Treu et al. (2005), Wirth et al. (2004), Cowie et al. (2004), 
# Cohen (2001), Cohen et al. (2000), Dawson et al. (2001). No quality flags were provided, so there is a 
# mix of reliable and less reliable redshifts in this field. There are 1837 galaxies with use_phot = 1 
# and a spectroscopic redshift.
