# Description from http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu/for-scientists/science/:
# The MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey fully exploits the new capabilities of MOSFIRE, charting 
# the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for ~1500 galaxies in three distinct redshift intervals 
# spanning 1.4 < z < 3.8 more than an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The MOSDEF team 
# has been awarded 44 nights of MOSFIRE observing time by the University of California Keck Time Allocation 
# Committee. This observing time spans four years during the period 2013 through 2016, in addition to an 
# initial allocation of 3 nights during December 2012. The MOSDEF survey is being conducted in three 
# extragalactic survey fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-N) with extensive multi-wavelength datasets spanning 
# from the radio to X-ray regimes. 
# 
# For spec-z quality flags, see the readme file "readme_mosdef_zcat.final". Some text are copied below:
# "Z_MOSFIRE" (fits tag: Z_MOSFIRE): MOSFIRE redshift. If no robust measurement, this field is set to -1.
# "Z_MOSFIRE_ZQUAL" (fits tag: Z_MOSFIRE_ZQUAL): Redshift quality flag, as follows:
#    7: Redshift is based on multiple emission features detected with S/N>=2, or else robust absorption-line redshift.
#    6: Redshift is based on single emission feature detected with S/N>=3, and is within 95% confidence interval of photo-z or within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    5: Redshift is based on single emission feature detected with 2<=S/N<3, and is within 95% confidence interval of photo-z or within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    4: Redshift is based on single emission feature detected with S/N>=3, and is neither within 95% confidence interval of photo-z nor within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    3: Redshift is based on single emission feature detected with 2<=S/N<3, and is neither within 95% confidence interval of photo-z nor or within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    2: Redshift is based on visual inspection, but no emission feature formally detected with S/N>=2, and is within 95% confidence interval of photo-z or within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    1: Redshift is based on visual inspection, but no emission feature formally detected with S/N>=2, and is neither within 95% confidence interval of photo-z nor within delta(z)=0.05 of pre-MOSFIRE spec-z (if it exists)
#    0: No redshift measured, either based on formal line detections or visual inspection (corresponds to Z_MOSFIRE=-1).
# "TARGET" (fits tag: TARGET): target status. If TARGET==1, the object listed is a primary target. If 
#    TARGET==0, the object listed is a serendipitous object.
# Notes:
# * Early MOSDEF masks were designed using 3D-HST v2.1 catalogs as input. 3D-HST v4.1 
#   ID matches have been found for all but 8 objects targeted using v2.1 IDs. For such
#   objects the v4.1 ID is listed as "-9999", and RA and DEC are taken from the 3D-HST
#   v2.1 catalogs.
# * This list includes multiple observations for 65 targets, including 56 galaxies with
#   2 observations and 9 galaxies with 3 observations. 
# * The SED fits for galaxies with Z_MOSFIRE_ZQUAL=1, 3, or 4 (i.e., those with <=1 one significant line detection,
#   yielding a redshift that doesn't match the prior redshift information) will be examined to determine if 
#   these redshift quality flags should be further downgraded.
