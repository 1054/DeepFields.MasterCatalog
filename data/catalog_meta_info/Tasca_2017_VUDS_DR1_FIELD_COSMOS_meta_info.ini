# Description of quality flags in LeFevre+2013 Section 3.4:
#   The flag may take the following values:
#     – 4: 100% probability of being correct;
#     – 3: 95–100% probability of being correct;
#     – 2: 75–85% probability of being correct;
#     – 1: 50–75% probability of being correct;
#     – 0: no redshift could be assigned;
#     – 9: spectrum with a single emission line. The redshift given
#     is the most probable; given the observed continuum. It has
#     a ∼80% probability of being correct.
#   More specific flags were built using a second digit in front of the reliability digit.
#     The first digit can be “1” indicating that at least one emission line is broad,
#     i.e. resolved at the observed spectral resolution, or “2” if the object is not the primary target in the slit but happens to fall in the
#     slit of a primary target by chance projection hence provides a
#     spectrum. For the VVDS-Ultra-Deep, we added a flag 1.5 corresponding to objects for which the spectroscopic flag is “1”,
#     and the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts match to within
#     dz = 0.05 × (1 + z).
