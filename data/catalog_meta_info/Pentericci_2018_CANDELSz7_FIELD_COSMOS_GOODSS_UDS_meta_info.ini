# Descriptions from Pentericci+2018:
# 
# CANDELSz7, a European Southern Observatory (ESO) Large Program aimed at spectroscopically confirming 
# a homogeneous sample of z ≃ 6 and z ≃ 7 star forming galaxies. The candidates were selected in the 
# GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS fields using the official CANDELS catalogs based on H160-band detections.
# 
# Deep, medium-resolution FORS2 spectroscopic observations were then conducted with integration times 
# ranging from 12 to 20 h to reach a Lyα flux limit of approximately 1-3 \times 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 at 3-sigma. 
# We could determine a spectroscopic redshift for about 40% of the galaxies. 
# 
# In this paper we present the redshifts and main properties of 65 newly confirmed high-redshift galaxies. 
# Adding previous proprietary and archival data we assemble a sample of ≃260 galaxies that we use to explore 
# the evolution of the Lyα fraction in Lyman break galaxies and the change in the shape of the emission 
# line between z ∼ 6 and z ∼ 7.
