# Notes on spec-z in Skelton+2014:
# There are 238 spectroscopic redshifts in the UDS catalog, 182 of which were obtained by matching to the compilation
# provided on the UDS Nottingham Web page [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/âˆ¼ppzoa/UDS_redshifts_18Oct2010.fits]
# The redshifts are from a variety of sources, with some unpublished at the time the compilation was made 
# (Yamada et al. 2005; Simpson et al. 2006; Geach et al. 2007; van Breukelen et al. 2007; Ouchi et al. 2008; 
# Smail et al. 2008; Ono et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2012; M. Akiyama et al., in preparation). Redshifts with 
# quality flags A (based on multiple reliable features), B (one reliable feature) or Z (flag not provided) are 
# included in our catalog. Redshifts with quality flag C (one dubious feature) are not included. We also include 
# 37 spectroscopic redshifts from IMACS/Magellan (Papovich et al. 2010, and I. Momcheva, private communication), 
# 18 redshifts from Bezanson et al. (2013) and 1 redshift from van de Sande et al. (2013). There are 178 galaxies 
# with use_phot = 1 and a spectroscopic redshift.
