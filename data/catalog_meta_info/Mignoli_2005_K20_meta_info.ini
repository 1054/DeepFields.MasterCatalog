# Description of quality flags on "https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/A+A/437/883/catalog":
#   Note (1)  : Quality flag on redshfit as follows:
#     1 = solid redshift determination;
#     0 = tentative redshift determination;
#     -1 =  no redshfit determination.
# 
#   Note (2)  : Spectroscopic classes as follows:
#     0 = objects classified as stars;
#     1 = red passive early-type galaxies;
#     2 = blue emission-line galaxies;
#     1.5 = intermediate galaxies with emission lines but red continuum indices;
#     3 = galaxies which are not included in one of the three previous classes;
#     4 = broad-line AGN. We remind that objects with only a tentative redshift (q_z=0) are not classified.
# 
# Note that by manually examining the catalog there are some rows with QUALITY_ZSPEC 16959 and ZSPEC 1E20. 
# We fix them to -99. 
# 
# Also note that this should be superceding the previous K20 K-band and spec-z catalog
#   Cimatti et al. 2002c (2002A&A...392..395C)
#   https://cdsarc.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/392/395
#   but the latter one has one more total number of object somehow, and has errors in K-band magnitude.

# FILETER should be the formatted column name with the "Telescope Instrument Band" information for output.
# WAVELENGTHS should be in units of micron meters.

# Photometry filters are not described well in the paper, 
# but the K-band photometry are in Cimatti et al. 2002d 
# https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...392..395C/abstract
#   For both fields, the Ks-band images were obtained with the
#   ESO NTT equipped with SOFI (Moorwood et al. 1998) with
#   a pixel size of 0.2900 and under photometric conditions (see
#   also Rengelink et al. 1998 for more details on observations and
#   database for the CDFS).
# 
#   Since the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS; http://www.
#   eso.org/science/eis/) public JKs images of the CDFS
#   available at the time of the K20 sample selection were affected
#   by a loss of the flux up to 0.3 magnitudes at the faint limit
#   of our survey, we performed a new independent reduction and
#   calibration of the CDFS Ks-band image.
#   
#   The Ks-band data of the CDFS and the JKs data of the
#   0055-2659 field were reduced in a standard manner using
#   the IRAF software package DIMSUM.
# 
# So for Ks photometry, see filter wavelength at:

# About the R-K, where does it come from? Likely ESO-MPG-2.2m WFI, if so, then filter information is at:
