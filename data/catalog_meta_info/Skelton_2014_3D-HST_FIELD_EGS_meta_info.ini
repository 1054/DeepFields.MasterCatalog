# Notes on spec-z in Skelton+2014:
# In the AEGIS field there are 1139 spectroscopic redshifts obtained by matching to the DEEP2+3 catalogs 
# (Davis et al. 2003; Newman et al. 2013; Cooper et al. 2012). Only objects with the highest quality flags 
# (quality flag = 4) are included in the catalog. There are 1094 galaxies with use_phot = 1 and a spectroscopic redshift.
