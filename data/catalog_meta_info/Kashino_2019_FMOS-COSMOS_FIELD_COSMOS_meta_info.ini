# Descriptions from readme file "fmos-cosmos_catalog_2019.README.txt":
# 
# Quality flag of the redshift: 
#   - zFlag>=1 is given for objects with approved detection of >=1 emission line(s).
#     zFlag=-1 for flux calibration stars.
#     zFlag=-99 if the spectroscopy failed.
# 
# Quality flags description in Silverman+2016 Section 9.1:
# • Flag 0: No emission line detected.
# • Flag 1 Presence of a single emission line with S/N
#   between 1.5 and 3.
# • Flag 2 One emission line having S/N greater than
#   3 and less than 5.
# • Flag 3 One emission line having S/N greater than
#   5.
# • Flag 4: One emission line having S/N greater than
#   5 (usually Hα) and a second line that both confirms
#   the redshift and has S/N greater than 1.5.
