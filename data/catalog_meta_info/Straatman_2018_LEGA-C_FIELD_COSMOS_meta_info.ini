# Description in the readme file:
#  From 2014 December to 2018 March, 20hr deep integrations have been
#  obtained for over 4000 targets with the Visible Multi-Object
#  Spectrograph (VIMOS) on the 8mm Very Large Telescope at Paranal in
#  Chile.
#  The Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey strategy
#  and science goals have been presented by van der Wel+
#  (2016ApJS..223...29V), accompanied by a first release of 892 spectra
#  and corresponding spectroscopic redshifts. In this paper we present
#  Data Release II (DR2).
#  The primary targets are chosen from a Ks-band magnitude-selected
#  parent sample of ~10000 galaxies with photometric redshifts z=0.6-1
#  drawn from the Ultra Deep Survey with the VISTA telescope (UltraVISTA)
#  catalog (Muzzin+ 2013, J/ApJS/206/8), which overlaps for the most part
#  with the already extensively photometrically covered COSMOS field
#  (Figure 1).
#  In this release we present the data from masks 1 through 15 out of the
#  total 32 masks which were observed during the ESO observing periods 94
#  to 98, from 2014 December to 2017 January.

# Quality flags description in Straatman+2018 Table 2:
#  f_z redshift flag (0: redshift detected)
#  f_spec spectral quality flag (0: good spectrum)
#  f_primary primary source flag (1: source primary)
#  f_use general quality flag (1: good to use)
#  f_int interpretation flag (0: no issues)
