# zp is Redshift where likelihood is maximized after applying the prior, p(z|m0)

# Note that Muzzin+2013 used the same UltraVISTA DR2 data as Laigle+2016, the COSMOS2015 catalog, 
# but they did not exclude many star masked regions as done in the latter work, therefore 
# have more sources surrounding bright stars than the latter one. Although this also means 
# that many sources around bright stars could be false detection because of the bright star
# contamination/saturation.
