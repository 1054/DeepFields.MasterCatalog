# For spec-z quality flags, see Section 4.2 of Garilli+2021. Some text are copied below:
# The redshift measurement strategy has been detailed in Pentericci et al. (2018b). 
# The reliability of the measured redshifts is quantified following a scheme similar to that
# used for the VVDS (Le Fèvre et al. 2005) and zCosmos surveys
# (Lilly et al. 2007). Measurements of galaxies are flagged using
# the following convention:
# – Flag 4: a highly reliable redshift (estimated to have > 99%
#           probability of being correct), based on a high S/N spectrum
#           and supported by obvious and consistent spectral features.
# – Flag 3: also a very reliable redshift, comparable in confidence with Flag 4, supported by clear spectral features in the
#           spectrum, but not necessarily with high S/N.
# – Flag 2: a fairly reliable redshift measurement, but not as
#           straightforward to confirm as for Flags 3 and 4, supported by
#           cross-correlation results, continuum shape and some spectral
#           features, with an expected chance of ' 75% of being correct.
#           We shall see in the following that the actual estimated confidence level turns out to be significantly better.
# – Flag 1: a reasonable redshift measurement, based on weak
#           spectral features and/or continuum shape, for which there is
#           roughly a 50% chance that the redshift is actually wrong.
# – Flag 0: no reliable spectroscopic redshift measurement was
#           possible.
# – Flag 9: a redshift based on only one single clear spectral
#           emission feature.
# – Flag -10: spectrum with clear problems in the observation or
#           data processing phases. It can be a failure in the vmmps Sky
#           to CCD conversion (especially at field corners), or a failed
#           extraction, or a bad sky subtraction because the object is too
#           close to the edge of the slit.
# 
# 
# We define an object as BLAGN when one emission line is resolved at the spectral resolution of the survey, and
# they are easily identified during the redshift measurement process. The flagging system for BLAGNs is similar, though not
# identical, to the one adopted for stars and galaxies:
# – Flag 14: secure BLAGN with a > 99% reliable redshift, including at least 2 broad lines;
# – Flag 13: secure BLAGN with good confidence redshift,
#            based on one broad line and some faint additional feature;
# – Flag 12: a > 75% reliable redshift measurement, but lines
#            are not significantly broad, might not be an BLAGN;
# – Flag 11: a tentative redshift measurement, with spectral features not significantly broad.
# – Flag 19: secure BLAGN with one single reliable emission
#            line feature, redshift based on this line only;
